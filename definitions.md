Fixed effect:
BLUE: As fixed effects, we obtain the best linear unbiased estimate (BLUE) of the variety effect, that is, the best estimate of the performance of that variety in that trial. 
BLUP: Treated as random effects, we obtain the best linear unbiased predictor (BLUP) of the variety effect, that is, the best estimate of the performance of that variety in future trials.
Historically, selection has been based on BLUE estimates and it is then observed that performance after release is usually not as good as that observed in trials. This is simply because future performance is predicted by the BLUP, not the BLUE.
